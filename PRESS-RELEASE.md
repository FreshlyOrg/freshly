There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Freshly.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Easily capture, explore and share activities and experiences all around us.  The core question Freshly helps answer: "What can we do?"

## Summary ##
  > Most of us have found ourselves wanting to do "something" (an activity), but at the same time, not knowing exactly what to do.  It’s hard to Google because we don’t know exactly what we are looking for.  This app allows users to discover new activities that exist all around us, as well as capture activities and experiences that they want to do later.  Our vision is to become the place everyone naturally goes to when wanting to do something, because of our ease-of-use, as well as because of our breadth of activities and experiences (with our community we aim to become the Wikipedia of activities and experiences).

## Problem ##
  > Ever felt like you’re in a rut and you’re not exactly sure what activities are available to you?  Interested in doing something fun, memorable and unique on Friday but not sure where to start? Do you want to find something fun and engaging for your children, but you feel like you’ve done everything around you?
  > There’s no easy way right now to save and search for activities (there are TONS of date night apps, event apps, etc).  For instance, recurring events (sports leagues, classes, volunteering) have no centralized location, so finding one that fits (in terms of location, cost, schedule, type of activity) is extremely difficult, and time consuming.

## Solution ##
  > As a mobile-first app, Freshly allows you to capture, explore and share activities and experiences.  Freshly can capture and keep-track-of activities you want to do.  Freshly can also intelligently presents crowdsourced activities around you that you might have not been aware of before. Did you know that there is a Trampoline Dodgeball league in Neighborhood x?  Or that people love going to a local magician that has an intimate vibe in Neighborhood y?

## Quote from You ##
  > "There are many activities that exist all around us, but many of the amazing ones are hidden from us.  Did you know there is a Trampoline Dodgeball League here in the city?  How about Segway Polo in the East Bay?  We seemingly can find standard tourist activities or things to do at clubs and bars; but, these type of activities only scratch the surface of the so-much that there is and can be done.  With Freshly, users can capture, explore and share activities and experiences all around us.  The beauty of Freshly is that you can easily save and later search for activities, as well as users will be able to add to the overall pool of activities.  Simply, the core question we answer is, "What can we do?"

## How to Get Started ##
  > On your smartPhone, download our app; or, in a browser go to our website: www.fresh.ly.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "This app is so awesome.  I have discovered so many cool activities to do with my family and friends.  I can’t tell you how many times I wanted to do something, but just didn’t know where to go or how to Google it (because I don’t exactly know what I’m looking for).  I usually resort to staying home and surfing the Internet or watching TV.  There are a bunch of apps out there, but they seem to focus on more touristy stuff.  The amazing thing is that many of these activities were all around me, just hidden!  Freshly just helped me to uncover them."
  > "Best way to find a sports league in San Francisco. Period.  They’ve got everything searchable by type, cost, day of the week, you name it."
